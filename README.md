## ðŸ“š About

This repository contains small, hands-on projects built to strengthen my understanding of the core technologies of the web â€” **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. 

These projects are part of my journey through the [Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) from **freeCodeCamp**, and they reflect my dedication to **continuous learning** and **professional growth**.
